# Static Dashboard (GitHub Pages Ready)

This repo hosts a single-page dashboard. You can deploy it on **GitHub Pages** with no build step.

## Quick start
1. Create a repo (public is easiest) and push these files.
2. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, set **Source: Deploy from a branch**, then choose the **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder. Save.
3. Wait a minute; your site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

> Tip: If you update data later, just re-build your HTML and replace `index.html` here.
